In contrast to\nother PhD programmes in the UK the MAT PhD programme provides an\nintegrated programme of taught modules and PhD research which\naccommodates students with existing Masters qualifications from\nother disciplines. The taught modules specifically train students in\nthe technologies and techniques used in inter-disciplinary research\nin Technologies for the Media and Arts.</p>\n<p>The PhD in Media and Arts Technology programme has three main\ncomponents:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Six advanced taught modules ranging from advanced technical skills to interaction design;</li>\n<li>An advanced research project;</li>\n<li>PhD research examined by thesis and viva.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The programme is structured as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Year 1: 90 credits of taught modules, and 90 credits of research project</li>\n<li>Years 2, 3, 4, 5: PhD research programme following the progression points of EECS PhD policies and procedures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main research groups contributing to the programme are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://antennas.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/\">Antennas</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/\">Centre for Digital Music</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cis.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/\">Centre for Intelligent Sensing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/\">Cognitive Science</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/research/view/multimedia-and-vision-mmv\">Multimedia and Vision</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.qmul.ac.uk/robotics/\">Advanced Robotics</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Year 1</h2>\n<p>Year 1 follows the structure of the MRes in Media and Arts\nTechnology. The taught modules give each cohort a common grounding\nin core technical and creative skills and ensure that each student\ndevelops enhanced skills through specialist options. We make\nextensive use of studio based projects with a variety of technical\nmedia, encourage a \"maker\" culture and integrate public presentation\ninto coursework assessments.</p>\n<p>Programming is taught as a fundamentally creative process and we\nunderline the importance of understanding arts practice to\nsuccessful technical work. In year 1 students take three core\nmodules, three advanced elective modules, and a research project.</p>\n<h2>Core modules are usually:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Interactive Digital Multimedia Techniques (\"IDMT\"; ECS742) covers\nphysical computing (sensors and microcontrollers) and creative\naudio/video programming with a focus on creating interactive\nsystems. Several IDMT coursework projects have subsequently been\naccepted at major international conferences like ACM CHI.</li>\n<li>Sound Recording and Production Techniques (ECS749) covers core\nprinciples of digital audio and practical techniques in\nmicrophones, mixing desks and audio post-production. By learning\nhow content is created, students are also better able to\nunderstand how best to analyse it.</li>\n<li>Advanced Research Methods (ECS719) covers the generic high-level\nresearch and transferable skills applicable to pure and applied\nresearch in computer science. It will also prepare students for\nemployment or further academic study by enabling them to apply\nthese in relevant, practical contexts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Suggested elective modules to choose from are:</h2>\n<p>Semester 1 (one elective):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Computer Programming (ECS780P) or Software &#x26; Network Services\nDesign (ECS705P) which both cover an introduction to\nprogramming for novice programmers.</li>\n<li>Design for Human Interaction (ECS712P) this research led module\nexplores the effectiveness of the design of new technologies by\nintroducing psychological theories of the nature of human\ncommunication and socio-historical perspectives on the development\nand impact of communication technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Semester 2 (two electives):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interactive System Design (ECS733P) covers design and evaluations\nof users interfaces and so compliments IDMT.</li>\n<li>Graphical User Interfaces (ECS744P) covers basic concepts of\npsychology Human-Computer Interaction which inform the way in\nwhich interfaces should be designed.</li>\n<li>Artificial Intelligence (ECS759P) provides an overview of\ntechniques used in Artificial Intelligence including agent\nmodelling, problem formulation, search, logic, probability and\nmachine learning.</li>\n<li>Music and Speech Modelling (ECS792P) introduces students to the\nmathematical and computational modelling of expressivity in music\nand in spoken language through a problem based learning approach.</li>\n<li>Digital Audio Effects (ECS730P) covers the entire field of digital\naudio effects, including some depth in the subfields and related\nsubjects. It is concerned with the use of digital signal\nprocessing and its applications to the creation or modification of\nsounds and sound effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other electives are possible from level 7 EECS Modules. Note that\ncore modules may change from year to year depending on availability\nand timetabling.</p>\n<p>The research project is a five month research project with the\nstudent’s identified PhD supervisor. The project provides an\nopportunity to put to practice the research skills learnt in the\ntaught modules, and to finalise the research proposal for the\nPhD study after year 1. The project is assessed by dissertation\nand viva.</p>\n<h2>Years 2, 3, 4</h2>\n<p>In years 2, 3, 4 students follow usual EECS PhD progress points and\nare examined as an EECS PhD student by submission of thesis and viva\nas per EECS PhD policies and procedures.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note</strong>: The MAT PhD Programme is a four year\nfull-time programme. You must be able to commit full-time to the\nprogramme. This is not a practice-based PhD. Final\nexamination of the PhD is by thesis and viva.</p>\n<p>Queries about the programme can be sent to Jonathan Winfield:\nj.winfield\"at\"qmul.ac.uk.</p>\n<h1>Scholarships</h1>\n<p>We accept self-funded applicants or scholarships from other\ngovernment and private sources.
