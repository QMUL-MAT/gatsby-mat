Each potentiometer sets the probability of a trigger occurring on a specific step (0%-100%). The device has two gate outputs per channel for sequencing external sources, as well as two audio outputs for internal sample playback. The sequencer accepts modular clock and reset signals.\nThe Hindu god Ganesh is known as the overcomer of obstacles. A particular obstacle in electronic music production (IMHO) is basic repetition, and overly ‘loop based’ musical structures. Many production tools subtlety promote loop-based practices though the implementation of binary possibilities for musical events in pitch and time.\nThe aim of the Ganesh Sequencer is to provide a probability-based approach to sequencing musical events. This is not a new concept compositionally or technically, and many great tools are already available such as the Malekko Varigate and Winter Moduar’s Eloqeuncer to name a few.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"the-ganesh-sequencer"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
