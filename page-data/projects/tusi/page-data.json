The global perception creates the optical illusion of a circular shape made up of spheres rotating and rolling over its centre, whereas the local perception is that each sphere moves along its own straight rectilinear path.\nThe presence of a singular red point amongst the others allows the viewer to access and realise the principle behind Tusi’s optical illusion.\nTusi shows how perceptual processes work: organising the information from a global structure towards a more fine-grained analysis. The identification of global structures being useful for the reduction of those stimuli to local structures.\n<a href=\"http://cinimodstudio.com/project/tusi-couple/\">http://cinimodstudio.com/project/tusi-couple/</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"tusi"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
