As the microbes grow and propagate, their growth patterns are live-streamed onto Mould Rush Game Channel on Twitch.tv, where the gameplay takes place. Every game, or ‘campaign’, is played in a completely unique landscape, formed by a seemingly-random nature in which microbial communities form and interact with each other. They help us to immerse ourselves in an alternative or parallel world, not shaped by computer simulations, but by real microbial jungles, grown by the tangible biological processes.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"mould-rush"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
