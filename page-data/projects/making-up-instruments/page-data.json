Within the domain of musical interaction, HCI research often examines new digital tools and technologies which can carry unstated cultural assumptions. This project takes a step back to present a value discovery exercise exploring the breadth of perspectives different communities might have in relation to the values inscribed in fictional technologies for musical interaction. We conducted a hands-on activity in which musicians active in different contexts were invited to envision not-yet-existent musical instruments.\nThe research aims to highlights the importance of cultural awareness and value rationality for the design of interactive systems within and beyond the musical domain.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"making-up-instruments"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
