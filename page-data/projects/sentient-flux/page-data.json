Presented by Nicola Plant (movement researcher, artist and programmer) and Alexander Adderley (3D Artist/Animator and Motion Graphics designer) the viewer will interact by agitating particles inhabiting the virtual space by using motion capture technology to track their movement. The experience explores what qualities of movement convey a sense of presence, a sentience that is alive and sympathetic to your existence. The piece aims to create a meditative space into which the only thing retained is movement.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"sentient-flux"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
