The object in fact becomes something else, a different version of a plunger (an “enhanced plunger”), and not in an expected way.\nThe object shows its “hidden” characteristic that is, to be a multimedia controller to generate visuals and sounds according to its movement, resembling that one of a game joystick. When the user interacts with it, the object assumes a completely different meaning and purpose, although its exterior looks exactly the same as before. In fact, the plunger is still a fully working plunger, none of the initial meaning was taken from the object while an additional one was added on top of it. With Plunge-it!, one could ideally plunge a sink and generating sounds and visuals at the same time.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"mat-cruftfest-plunge-it"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
