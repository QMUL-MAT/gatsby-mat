The sound is modulated by creating interferences between the transmitting and the receiving antenna.\nREBUS can remind of a Theremin and can be programmed to emulate one, but the compositional possibilities and applications of this instrument are potentially infinite. The question whether the senses can be trained to perceive the electromagnetic field and generate new forms of perception is immanent to the work.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"rebus","subItems":"projects/rebus"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
