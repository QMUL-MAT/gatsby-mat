A thermal printer was added to allow users’ to print a receipt of their data transaction, and to serve as an explanation.\nThe project was an output from a larger piece of research into how to raise awareness of data privacy and usage issues for digitally-vulnerable people.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"sweet-data"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
