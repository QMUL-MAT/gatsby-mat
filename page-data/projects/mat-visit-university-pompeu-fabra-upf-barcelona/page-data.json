This event is run by the department of Information and Communication Technologies at UPF. The poster session highlighted shared research interests with MAT students, including VR and AR, speech recognition, Music Information Retrieval, sound synthesis, accessible instruments, instrument learning and much more. Following the poster session, the Music Technology Group hosted a seminar in which they presented their very latest work and findings. The visit was a great opportunity to discover research that challenged and inspired our own practices, as well as to share and discuss our work with researchers at similar stages in their academic career.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"mat-visit-university-pompeu-fabra-upf-barcelona"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
