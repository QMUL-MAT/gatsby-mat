Sound design in game and film relies either on large but still limited sample libraries or time-consuming Foley. Sound synthesis offers an alternative but is often too computational or lacking realism. A design objective is that the models are able to operate in real time whilst maintaining core mathematical concepts taken from the field of fluid dynamics. Models will be evaluated by comparison to results obtained through computational fluid dynamics as well as perceptually through listening tests. Once the central models have been developed it is then expected that these can be combined to achieve a broader range of models. It is also a goal to expand the basic synthesis models to incorporate more properties of the objects themselves to increase authenticity and accuracy of the sounds produced.\nÂ \nFurther information: <a href=\"https://rodselfridge.wordpress.com/\">https://rodselfridge.wordpress.com/</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"real-time-sound-synthesis-of-aeroacoustic-sounds-using-physically-derived-models"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
