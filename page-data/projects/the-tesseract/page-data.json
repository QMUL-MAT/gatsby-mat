The interface is designed to foster heuristic development, and quickly leads an effective mix of intuitive and indeterminate responses. The Tesseract can be used alone, or as a participatory tool for generative listening, composition or performance.\nBeneath the physical interface, a rule based system combines elements in such a way as to afford agency to its user/s, while maintaining a degree of tonal, timbral and rhythmical hierarchy.\nThe Tesseract is an experiment in music release and seeks to question the relationship we have with a musical product. In our post-modern world of remix culture, the object is merely a reflection of that once real; surely the only reality then is that which resists reflection (Baudrillard 1994/ Debord 1984).</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"the-tesseract"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
