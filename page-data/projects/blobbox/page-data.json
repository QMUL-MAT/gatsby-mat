But how do we interact with our devices? How might they become a more intuitive extension of ourselves? BLOBBOX is an attempt to imagine an alternative narrative where hand recognition becomes the predominant interface. It asks how applications, images and code might look and function beyond traditional computer models. This experiment is demonstrated by a transformative, playful yet eerily ambiguous blob, which, in its undefinable materiality and sterile container, alludes to a laboratory that must test new materials through simulation.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"blobbox"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
