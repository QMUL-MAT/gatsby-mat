Is it possible to go beyond it? What happens when the passive interaction that is happening within the allowed area is not enough? Are we able to set ourselves in a position of “active” interaction and to gain control over the edges of our box?</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"noteallowed-2"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
