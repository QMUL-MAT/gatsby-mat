The experiment has been designed to compare the performance of three smart textile strain sensors, conductive fabric Techik-tex P130B with no reinforcement, conductive fabric Techik-tex P130B with Eurojersey backing, and Techik-tex P130B with Eurojersey bonded top and bottom. The sensorsâ€™ performance was tested using a tensile tester while monitoring their resistance with a microcontroller. Each sensor underwent a dynamic test, static test and wash test. The finding shows that bonding and washing effects sensors properties.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"stretch-sensors-properties","subItems":"projects/stretch-sensors-properties"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
