It’s been made using stretch conductive fabric from EMF, 47Ohm resistors, 1M resistors, conductive tape, continuous servomotor and a piezo. The drum is triggered by human electrical capacitance. The stretchy bands are triggered by pulling them. The servomotor is activated by blowing on the piezo which triggers the windmill to spin.\nThe “Snoezelen” rooms developed in the Netherlands around the 70s and used therapeutically for people with Special Needs inspired the idea behind Sensiwall. The aim was to have different inputs modalities thanks to which the users should have made different actions in order to trigger a variety of events to happen. In order to implement a diverse sensory diet like auditory, tactile, visual and proprioceptive stimuli I choose to create a wooden surface as the main background wall and attached different elements to it by means of drilling into the panel or gluing objects onto it.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"sensiwall"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
