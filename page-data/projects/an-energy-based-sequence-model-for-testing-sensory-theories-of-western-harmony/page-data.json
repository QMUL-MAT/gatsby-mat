We introduce new methods for analysing this relationship, and apply them to large corpora representing three prominent genres of Western music: classical, popular,\nand jazz music. These methods centre on a generative sequence model with an exponential-family energy-based form that predicts chord sequences from continuous features.\nWe use this model to investigate one aspect of instantaneous consonance (harmonicity) and two aspects of sequential consonance (spectral distance and voice-leading distance). Applied to our three musical genres, the results\ngenerally support the relationship between sensory consonance and harmony, but lead us to question the high importance attributed to spectral distance in the psychological literature. We anticipate that our methods will provide a useful platform for future work linking music psychology\nto music theory.\n<a href=\"http://publications.pmcharrison.com/2018/2018-ismir.pdf\">http://publications.pmcharrison.com/2018/2018-ismir.pdf</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"an-energy-based-sequence-model-for-testing-sensory-theories-of-western-harmony","subItems":"projects/an-energy-based-sequence-model-for-testing-sensory-theories-of-western-harmony"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
