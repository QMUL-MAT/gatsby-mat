Actors\\’ movements were triangulated from camera footage taken while they rehearsed a short script especially commissioned for the project over the course of a day. Four groups took part. Data on actors\\’ positions relative to one another and the camera/audience was compared between groups and between conditions to find out how actors use space to express narrative choices and how their movements changed when performing for a 360 camera.\nFindings from The Geometry of Storytelling project were presented at CHI 2017. The paper is available here.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"the-geometry-of-storytelling"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
