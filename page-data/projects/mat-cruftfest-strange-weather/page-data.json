With this inertia thinking, people connect the umbrella with rain. The idea of creating this umbrella is to break the normal concept of this connection based on the changeable weather in London. This Umbrella detects the userâ€™s behaviour by monitoring the angle and status of fold/unfold, and then it gives the corresponding response to the user. If the user unfolds the umbrella (switch on) and puts the umbrella up (the value read by accelerometer is smaller than the threshold), then Processing will get the signal to change the state of weather to sunny. Otherwise, Processing will get the signal of keep raining.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"mat-cruftfest-strange-weather"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
