Consequently, there are many open research questions on how to design VR user experiences to support Collaborative Music Making (CMM).\nWe created a virtual music making tool called Let’s Move (LeMo), which is a social virtual environment for CMM. LeMo provides two people with a shared virtual reality musical interface with which they can make music together. The studies during my PhD focus on LeMo and are aiming at exploring the impact of different interaction cues (visual, aural, proximity, annotation, awareness and so on) on CMM.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"lemo-supporting-collaborative-music-making-in-virtual-reality"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
