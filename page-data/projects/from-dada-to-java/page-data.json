It’s a question that has been floating around for a while. In From Dada to Java: conversations about generative poetry &#x26; Twitter bots, Sophie Skach, Betül Aksu, Victor Loux, and Zhou Tang speak to artists and theorists about how generative works can sit side by side with literature’s greats. Coming as a continuation from avant-garde practices such as Dada and Oulipo, the bot lives comfortably in randomness and offers a chance to value the computer’s art as a product in and of itself.”  Decorating Dissidence\nFrom Dada to Java is included in the Internet Archive, is reviewed by Procedural Generation, and by Urszula Pawlicka-Deger. The documentary inspired a title in the book “Digital Media and Textuality: From Creation to Archiving”.\nExhibitions\n• Take Dada Seriously?, curated by Decorating Dissidence &#x26; Guest Projects London (2020)\n• Intersections, Mile End Art Pavilion London (2016)</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"projects","slug":"from-dada-to-java"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
