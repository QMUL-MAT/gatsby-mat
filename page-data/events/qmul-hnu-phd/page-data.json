This PhD will research the Interaction Design of more interactive and understandable user interfaces for generative music AI systems. This will include researching how existing AI tools are used in musical practice and how to design, build, and evaluate more intuitive user interfaces for generative AI, though the candidate has the opportunity to explore many different approaches to Interaction Design for AI music generation and centre their work on its explainability around their own interests. The PhD may optionally include elements of cross-cultural generative AI design. The PhD will involve elements of interactive visualisation and Human Computer Interaction as well as some aspects of AI and Machine Learning. The candidate does not need to have existing expertise in AI or Music, but some would be advantageous.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. George Fazekas</strong> <a href=\"http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gyorgyf/\">http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gyorgyf/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Topic: Innovation in AI Across the Creative Industries</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Brief description:</strong>\nThere are many opportunities for AI research and development across the Creative Industries. This PhD project will be on one of the following topics for AI design, build, and evaluation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hybrid methods which blend AI with human creativity and creative practice throughout the creative pipeline from creation to distribution and consumption;</li>\n<li>Shared data sets between companies and research institutions to increase the qualityand diversity of AI training, thereby increasing AI reliability and creativity;</li>\n<li>Cross-Cultural use of AI to customize experiences, services, and content to local cultures and norms, and opportunities to train AI across cultures to improve its creativity;</li>\n<li>Enhanced access to Chinese music and musical instrument databases, datasets, and taxonomies;</li>\n<li>Novel application of state-of-the-art AI techniques for digital music adaption across Western and Chinese music;</li>\n<li>Proof-of-concept app that allows users and consumers to dynamically navigate cross-cultural renderings of music composition.</li>\n</ul>"},"projects":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"category":"events","slug":"qmul-hnu-phd","subItems":"events/qmul-hnu-phd"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
