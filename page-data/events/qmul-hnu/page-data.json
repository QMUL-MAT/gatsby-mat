We need to match HNU applicants with QMUL academics and PhD topics and then conduct PhD application interviews and selection.</p>\n<p>The following conditions are the same as with our other general CSC allocations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Any member of staff is only able to be primary supervisor for one new CSC per year (whether allocated through Hunan Uni or through the central CSC competition).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Principal supervisors must have existing live grant funding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Principal supervisors must use the allocation to leverage grant funding and will be required to submit grant application(s) using the PhD as host support.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Supervisors must ensure sufficient consumables funding to be able to undertake the proposed PhD research project.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, HNU plan to invite QMUL supervisors into their Uni’s admissions and supervisory committees to help to make the interviews and decisions on which applicants to allocate the CSC studentships to.</p>\n<p>About QMUL and Hunan’s Collaborations</p>\n<p>The arrangement is with Hunan University (China) who QMUL have worked with for over 8 years now, including Masters student recruitment from HNU and collaboratives Masters programmes with HNU, PhD student recruitment from HNU, and research projects with HNU.
