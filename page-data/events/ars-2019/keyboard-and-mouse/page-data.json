Could replacing plastic, metal and glass (the ubiquitous materials of online interaction) with natural, gentle, tactile, transient alternatives, allow for more humanity in our digitality?</p>\n<p>The keyboard is created almost entirely from wool, with layers of differening thickness to replicate the keyboard base, key switches and key caps found on typical plastic and metal consumer keyboards.</p>\n<h1>About the artist <a href=\"/students/jack-ratcliffe/\">(view profile)</a></h1>\n<p><a href=\"/students/jack-ratcliffe/\">Jacktionman</a> is a London-based artist who specialises in mixed-reality installations that playfully explore humanity’s relationship with technology. His most notable works include Teletortoise, in which anonymous internet users are able to remotely feed, water, and illuminate turtles, and Emojikken, where visitors are invited to conduct conversations using only a 1600+ emoji keyboard.</p>\n<p>Previous exhibitions include the V&#x26;A, the British Library, the Barbican and the BBC.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"events/ars-2019","slug":"keyboard-and-mouse","subItems":"events/ars-2019/keyboard-and-mouse"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
