By touching the conductive patches on the cloth, powers assigned to the elements of this world and energies of the universe are called upon to generate new knowledge and meaning.</p>\n<p>The “old” periodic alignments of the stars are a poetic parallelism to the “new” periodic alignments of the Markov chains used for casting a spell and generating an incantation.</p>\n<h1>About the artist <a href=\"/students/anna-nagele/\">(view profile)</a></h1>\n<p><a href=\"/students/anna-nagele/\">Anna</a> is an experience designer with an interest in ethics of representation and storytelling in human-machine interactions.</p>\n<p>Through her work she explores the impact of technologies on human identities. She develops technologies that stimulate alternative narratives and call for the creation of fairer futures.</p>\n<p>Anna also holds an MA in Innovation Management from Central Saint Martins and has created work for the BBC and the startup Wisp, among others.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"events/ars-2019","slug":"machina-incantaii","subItems":"events/ars-2019/machina-incantaii"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
