At the same time, the tempo of an accompanying song by dance band Stats fluctuates with your heartbeat as you breathe and move.</p>\n<h1>About the artist <a href=\"/students/nicolerobson/\">(view profile)</a></h1>\n<p><a href=\"/students/nicolerobson/\">Nicole Robson</a> is a classically trained musician and sound artist based in London and Deal, UK. Her practice explores the embodiment of sound in architectural spaces and objects through site-specific performance, algorithmic composition, and interactive installations.</p>\n<p>Nicole enjoys working on community-focused, public art and heritage projects and has created work for the BBC, NHS, and Mayor of London.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"events/ars-2019","slug":"rhythm-of-the-heart","subItems":"events/ars-2019/rhythm-of-the-heart"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
