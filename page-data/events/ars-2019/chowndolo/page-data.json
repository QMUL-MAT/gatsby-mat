The magnets at the bottom of the pendulum can be arranged to compose new shapes. Different configurations will therefore modify the pendulum oscillations and the sonic patterns.</p>\n<h1>About the artist <a href=\"/students/lalepre/\">(view profile)</a></h1>\n<p><a href=\"/students/lalepre/\">Giacomo</a> is a musician, sonic interaction designer and researcher. Although he is specialised in not being specialised, his work often involves the development of interactive musical systems for electroacoustic improvisation and interactive sonic sculptures.</p>\n<p>He is currently busy with a PhD research exploring the cultural implications of new musical instrument design at the Augmented Instruments Laboratory.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"events/ars-2019","slug":"chowndolo","subItems":"events/ars-2019/chowndolo"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
