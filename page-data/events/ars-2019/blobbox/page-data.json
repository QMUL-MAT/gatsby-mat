How might they become a more intuitive extension of ourselves? BLOBBOX is an attempt to imagine an alternative narrative where hand recognition becomes the predominant interface. It asks how applications, images and code might look and function beyond traditional computer models.</p>\n<p>This experiment is demonstrated by a transformative, playful yet eerily ambiguous blob, which, in its undefinable materiality and sterile container, alludes to a laboratory that must test new materials through simulation.</p>\n<h1>About the artist <a href=\"/students/sebastian/\">(view profile)</a></h1>\n<p><a href=\"/students/sebastian/\">Sebastian Löbbers</a> is an artist and researcher working in digital media, sound and interactive design. His works have been staged and exhibited internationally in galleries, performance halls and music venues, often in collaboration with choreographers, writers and theorists.</p>\n<p>Recent projects have been displayed at the Rough Sketches Project, Trinity Laban and WeSA Festival (Seoul). His current research explores embodied music creation through motion capture with a focus on digital interfaces.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"events/ars-2019","slug":"blobbox","subItems":"events/ars-2019/blobbox"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
