The idea was that of creating an orchestra where different instruments are activated by pulling the coloured stretch lycra.</p>\n<p>Each instrument plays a different scale of notes. When the lycra strings are pulled together the sounds form a soothing composition and the users are able to create different harmonies.</p>\n<p>The work was developed to stimulate social interactions during play time with Ολοι for a group of five minimally to non-verbal children with autism who like music.</p>\n<h1>About the artist <a href=\"/students/ant/\">(view profile)</a></h1>\n<p><a href=\"/students/ant/\">Antonella</a>'s work aims to go beyond the limitations of the WIMP archetype and aspire to promote children’s well-being by developing multisensory experiences.</p>\n<p>Her research focuses on making sonic tangible user interfaces (TUI) for minimally to non-verbal autistic children to stimulate social skills during leisure and recreational activities while providing means for self-regulation opportunities.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"events/ars-2019","slug":"olly","subItems":"events/ars-2019/olly"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
