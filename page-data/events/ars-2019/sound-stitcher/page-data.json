Although it no longer functions as before, participants can still interact with its variety of controls to design noise instead of cloth.</p>\n<p>With each interaction, the acoustic properties of sounds generated by the piece become mangled and distorted beyond recognition, paying homage to the battery and abandonment these discarded pieces of machinery have endured over the years.</p>\n<h1>About the artist <a href=\"/students/brendanoc\">(view profile)</a></h1>\n<p><a href=\"/students/brendanoc\">Brendan</a> is a performer, composer and sound artist, focusing on experimental noise and interactive technology.</p>\n<p>He has presented his work with creative, media-interactive communities such as Hackoustic, Heart N Soul, and the Irish Sound Science and Technology Association. Brendan enjoys designing music that makes one stop and think about sound at the atomic level, and expects to delve into this further during his PhD research which focuses on harvesting the human voice for its musical qualities and compositional potential.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"events/ars-2019","slug":"sound-stitcher","subItems":"events/ars-2019/sound-stitcher"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
