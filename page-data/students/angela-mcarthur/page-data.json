She's worked in studio, live and location environments, and her work draws from the technologies, perception and art of spatial sound, to tackle an intersection of the three. She draws from eco-feminist discourse about the natural environment, and non-human ontologies. She is currently focused on spatial listening as aesthetic practice, and the embodiment of space through sound. She co-produced a Sheffield Docfest-shortlisted VR film in 2017, is working with a US-based geo-scientist's infrasonic sound for an upcoming installation, and is artist in residency at IEM / Kunst Uni Graz in 2019, working with the IKO loudspeaker array.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"students","slug":"angela-mcarthur"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
