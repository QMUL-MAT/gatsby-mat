My current research focuses on developing cognitive training and rehabilitation programs using immersive technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR). Using machine learning, we can assess the userâ€™s affective states, progress and struggles to adapt the training and provide a more effective and personalised program. Daniel is also interested in video games and gamification as a tool to engage users, not only in training but also in education and learning programs. He strongly believe games are not only an art form but also a serious media.</p>"},"projects":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"category":"students","slug":"daniel-gabana-arellano","subItems":"students/daniel-gabana-arellano"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
