Her research explores the concept of illusion by creating electromagnetic environments that stimulate new forms of perception.</p>\n<p>Invisible affordances become a means to control and communicate with the machine, whose aesthetics inspire the sentiment of the sublime. Musical instruments and interactive systems allow, then, a form of expressive interaction that includes moments of hesitation, uncertainty, surprise. Technology, like a companion, reclaims the possibility of going out of control, in that tension between programmability, virtuosity and causality.</p>\n<p>Thesis title: \"Audiovisual performance composition using electromagnetic waves\".\r\nSupervisors: Clive Parini and Andrew mcPherson</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"students","slug":"xname"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
