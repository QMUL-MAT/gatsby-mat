Clearly, he is specialised in not being specialised. However, his research is at the intersection of music composition / improvisation, instrument design and HCI.\r\nThe focus is on the design of new musical instruments informed by cultural studies linked to communities of musical practices.\r\nGiacomo explores compositional strategies for the mediation of musical values and technological agencies, considering the practice of sonic interaction design as an opportunity to play with illusions and magic.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"students","slug":"lalepre"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
