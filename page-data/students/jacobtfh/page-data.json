His research focuses on accessibility in musical instrument design - designing instruments for disabled musicians and those with access needs. Specifically, he is focusing on 'performance-focused' instruments, as opposed to the more common therapy-centric devices designed for disabled musicians. The goal is to enable greater access to performative musical cultures through instrument design. In his work, he has developed a number of prototype instruments to explore these ideas. These include the Adapted Bass Guitar, a mechanical adaptation to a bass guitar which frets the strings, and the 'Strummi', a hybrid acoustic/digital guitar instrument.</p>"},"projects":{"nodes":[{"frontmatter":{"title":"The One-Handed Bass Guitar","year":"2016","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9ef67d9b4f4e6e757dfa6d27b940442f/bb374/the-one-handed-bass-guitar.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9ef67d9b4f4e6e757dfa6d27b940442f/37931/the-one-handed-bass-guitar.jpg 150w,\n/static/9ef67d9b4f4e6e757dfa6d27b940442f/5a8ad/the-one-handed-bass-guitar.jpg 300w,\n/static/9ef67d9b4f4e6e757dfa6d27b940442f/bb374/the-one-handed-bass-guitar.jpg 600w,\n/static/9ef67d9b4f4e6e757dfa6d27b940442f/d7355/the-one-handed-bass-guitar.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9ef67d9b4f4e6e757dfa6d27b940442f/d3648/the-one-handed-bass-guitar.webp 150w,\n/static/9ef67d9b4f4e6e757dfa6d27b940442f/ee9cf/the-one-handed-bass-guitar.webp 300w,\n/static/9ef67d9b4f4e6e757dfa6d27b940442f/b6a46/the-one-handed-bass-guitar.webp 600w,\n/static/9ef67d9b4f4e6e757dfa6d27b940442f/eb8e2/the-one-handed-bass-guitar.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":385}}}},"fields":{"category":"projects","slug":"the-one-handed-bass-guitar"}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"students","slug":"jacobtfh","subItems":"students/jacobtfh"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
