His research focuses on accessibility in musical instrument design - designing instruments for disabled musicians and those with access needs. Specifically, he is focusing on 'performance-focused' instruments, as opposed to the more common therapy-centric devices designed for disabled musicians. The goal is to enable greater access to performative musical cultures through instrument design. In his work, he has developed a number of prototype instruments to explore these ideas. These include the Adapted Bass Guitar, a mechanical adaptation to a bass guitar which frets the strings, and the 'Strummi', a hybrid acoustic/digital guitar instrument.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"category":"students","slug":"jacobtfh"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
