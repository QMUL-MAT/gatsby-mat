This research is motivated by the desire to be part of the movement to make musical expression accessible to all, by collaborating with organisations and individuals who are pushing the boundaries of disability arts. This resonates with an interest to contribute to a growing field around the potential of Accessible Digital Musical Instruments (ADMIs) to improve access to music and to help shift research in this area to be not only informed, but led by disabled musicians and their needs, honouring the 'Nothing about us without us' adage from disability rights activism.</p>"},"projects":{"nodes":[]}},"pageContext":{"category":"students","slug":"luiszayas","subItems":"students/luiszayas"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
