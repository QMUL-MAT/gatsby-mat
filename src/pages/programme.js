          <h1>PHD PROGRAMME STRUCTURE</h1>
          <p>
            The PhD builds on the outstanding success of Queen Mary’s Media and
            Arts Technology (MAT) Centre for Doctoral Training. In contrast to
            other PhD programmes in the UK the MAT PhD programme provides an
            integrated programme of taught modules and PhD research which
            accommodates students with existing Masters qualifications from
            other disciplines. The taught modules specifically train students in
            the technologies and techniques used in inter-disciplinary research
            in Technologies for the Media and Arts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The PhD in Media and Arts Technology programme has three main
            components:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Six&nbsp;advanced taught modules ranging from advanced technical
              skills to interaction design;
            </li>
            <li>An advanced research project;</li>
            <li>PhD research examined by thesis and viva.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The programme is structured as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Year 1: 90 credits of taught modules, and 90 credits of research
              project
            </li>
            <li>
              Years 2, 3, 4, 5: PhD research programme following the progression
              points of EECS PhD policies and procedures
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Year 1</h4>
          <p>
            Year 1 follows the structure of the MRes in Media and Arts
            Technology. The taught modules give each cohort a common grounding
            in core technical and creative skills and ensure that each student
            develops enhanced skills through specialist options. We make
            extensive use of studio based projects with a variety of technical
            media, encourage a “maker” culture and integrate public presentation
            into coursework assessments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Programming is taught as a fundamentally creative process and we
            underline the importance of understanding arts practice to
            successful technical work. In year 1 students take three core
            modules, three advanced elective modules, and a research project.
          </p>
          <h4>Core modules are usually:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Interactive Digital Multimedia Techniques (“IDMT”; ECS742) covers
              physical computing (sensors and microcontrollers) and creative
              audio/video programming with a focus on creating interactive
              systems. Several IDMT coursework projects have subsequently been
              accepted at major international conferences like ACM CHI.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sound Recording and Production Techniques (ECS749) covers core
              principles of digital audio and practical techniques in
              microphones, mixing desks and audio post-production. By learning
              how content is created, students are also better able to
              understand how best to analyse it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advanced Research Methods (ECS719) covers the generic high-level
              research and transferable skills applicable to pure and applied
              research in computer science. It will also prepare students for
              employment or further academic study by enabling them to apply
              these in relevant, practical contexts.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Suggested elective modules to choose from are:</h4>
          <p>Semester 1 (one elective):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Computer Programming (ECS780P) or Software &amp; Network Services
              Design (ECS705P) which both cover&nbsp;an introduction to
              programming for novice programmers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Design for Human Interaction (ECS712P) this research led module
              explores the effectiveness of the design of new technologies by
              introducing psychological theories of the nature of human
              communication and socio-historical perspectives on the development
              and impact of communication technologies.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Semester 2 (two electives):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Interactive System Design (ECS733P) covers design and evaluations
              of users interfaces and so compliments IDMT.
            </li>
            <li>
              Graphical User Interfaces (ECS744P) covers&nbsp;basic concepts of
              psychology Human-Computer Interaction&nbsp;which inform the way in
              which interfaces should be designed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Artificial Intelligence (ECS759P) provides an overview of
              techniques used in Artificial Intelligence including agent
              modelling, problem formulation, search, logic, probability and
              machine learning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Music and Speech Modelling (ECS792P) introduces students to the
              mathematical and computational modelling of expressivity in music
              and in spoken language through a problem based learning approach.
            </li>
            <li>
              Digital Audio Effects (ECS730P) covers the entire field of digital
              audio effects, including some depth in the subfields and related
              subjects. It is concerned with the use of digital signal
              processing and its applications to the creation or modification of
              sounds and sound effects.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Other electives are possible from level 7 EECS Modules. Note that
            core modules may change from year to year depending on availability
            and timetabling.
          </p>
          <p>
            The research project is a five month research project with the
            student’s identified PhD supervisor. The project provides an
            opportunity to put to practice the research skills learnt in the
            taught modules, and to finalise&nbsp;the research proposal for the
            PhD study after year 1. The&nbsp;project is assessed by dissertation
            and viva.
          </p>
          <h4>Years 2, 3, 4</h4>
          <p>
            In years 2, 3, 4 students follow usual EECS PhD progress points and
            are examined as an EECS PhD student by submission of thesis and viva
            as per EECS PhD policies and procedures.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Please note</strong>: The MAT PhD Programme is a four year
            full-time programme. You must be able to commit full-time to the
            programme.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is not a practice-based PhD.&nbsp;Final
            examination of the PhD is by thesis and viva.
