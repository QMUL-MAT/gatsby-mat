# Public Transport

The Mile End campus is well-served by public transport and is a short walk from either Mile End or Stepney Green tube station.

By tube take the Central Line to Mile End station and walk westwards along Mile End Road (towards the City) or take the District Line or the Hammersmith & City Line to Stepney Green station and turn left as you come out of the station heading eastwards along Mile End Road.

By bus take the number 25 (Oxford Circus to Ilford) and get off near Bancroft Road. There are a number of other services stopping within five minutesâ€™ walk of the site, including the 277 (Highbury and Islington to Canary Wharf) and Docklands services. For DLR and other travel information, please refer to the main College website.
