Our unique four year PhD programme and one year Masters by Research in Media and Arts Technology were built around core courses in advanced research methods, interaction design and digital media processing, production and recording techniques and optional specialist modules ranging from Digital Audio Effects through Digital Rights Management to Interaction Design.

Our programmes produced post-graduates who combine world-class technical and creative skills and who have a unique vision of how digital technology transforms creative possibilities and social economies.
