The **Listening Room** is an acoustically isolated room for audio recordings and experiments where low reverberation and very low ambient noise are important. The space is equipped for high-end multi-channel audio recording and playback. A 16-speaker ambisonic system can be used for immersive surround sound research and high quality audio recording is possible using our Focusrite mic preamps and 24-channel SSL AD/DA MADI converters routed to other acoustic facilities.

The **Studio Control Room** is set up with a high-end Mac-based digital audio workstation running various recording software including Logic and Cubase for recording performances or post production.
