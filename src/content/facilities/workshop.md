Physical computing plays a big part in the Media and Arts Technology programme. The MAT Workshop was established by MAT PhD students and is now a fully functional place to develop prototypes with physical materials. Students have access to a range of manual and power tools, as well as soldering stations and electronics components. Our most used items of equipment are the two lasercutters, both a 60 Watt and a high powered 150 Watt machine.

MAT students have 24 hour access to the workshop which is a messy environment where wood, acrylic, textiles, electronics and other materials come together to create designs, products and innovations of the future.
