The **Performance Space** can be used for a variety of performance research and recording applications including motion capture, audio recording of large ensembles, interactive art installations, use as a film/video sound stage and many more.

It is one of the Schoolâ€™s larger spaces with a high ceiling (approx 9m x 8m) with all surfaces painted in matte black. There are hanging points and an integrated DMX lighting rig in the ceiling of this lab space for lights/projectors/speakers/screens etc.

Students also have access to the separate Augmented Human Interaction (AHI) Lab with Vicon Motion Capture System.
