MAT students had access to a dedicated mobile VR and Augmented Reality (AR) resource including a suite of HTC Vive headsets, Oculus Rift headsets, 6 x 4k cameras and a 360 degree camera rig, Leap Motion sensors with VR mounts, headphones for independent head-tracking, Kolor video stitching software and prototyping equipment such as a Rico Theta camera, and Samsung Gear headset.

MAT students worked with industry and other QMUL departments to develop VR applications, films, and workshops, as well as to carry out a range of research in this exciting new medium.
