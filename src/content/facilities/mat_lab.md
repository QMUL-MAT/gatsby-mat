Our flexible community space is used for informal presentations and seminars, as well as providing a dynamic, hot-desk style working environment for all Media and Art Technologies students at any stage of their study. We encourage students to host their own events and group meetings here.

This main convening point contains 8 movable intersecting tables, chairs for 50 and projector, speakers and a screen. It also hosts our resident art work - the MAT chandelier, an 8-screen sculpture that can be programmed to feature a variety of visual work.
