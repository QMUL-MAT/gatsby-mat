Our specialised materials processing workshop enables precision prototyping and fabrication. Projects developed in house range from wearable electronics, soft robotics, and interactive soft circuits. We keep a range of consumables for experimentation, including 30 conductive textiles, liquid silicone, sample materials and conductive ink.

Equipment includes a 10 spool embroidery machine with add-on components for circular and larger-scale projects, an Objet 30 Prime stereolithography 3D printer, a FujiFilm Dimatix high precision deposition printer, a vinyl cutter, and a heat press.
