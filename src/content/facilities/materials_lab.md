Our specialised materials processing workshop enables precision prototyping and fabrication. Projects developed in house by MAT students ranged from wearable electronics, soft robotics, and interactive soft circuits. The materials lab keeps a range of consumables for experimentation, including 30 conductive textiles, liquid silicone, sample materials and conductive ink.

Equipment includes a 10 spool embroidery machine with add-on components for circular and larger-scale projects, an Objet 30 Prime stereolithography 3D printer, a FujiFilm Dimatix high precision deposition printer, a vinyl cutter, and a heat press.
