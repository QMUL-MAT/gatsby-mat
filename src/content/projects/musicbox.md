MusicBox is a digital tool that allows anyone to upload a video and to create sounds from it in the same way that a music box does: by reading sequences of blobs and transforming them into sounds.  Users can draw a custom line that will work as a keyboard, and every time a dot passes this line, a sound is triggered.
