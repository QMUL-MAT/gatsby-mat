Mind the Chair is an interactive installation which focuses on giving a real time audio/visual representation of the activity of our brain, and to show how it can be possible to control it. In fact, the installation allows to visualize the level of concentration of a person, through an audio/visual answer (LED lights and sounds generation/manipulation).
While using the headset it is easy to understand how it is possible to ‘control’ our brain and therefore to intervene on our level of concentration, to modify light intensity or filtering the sound.
