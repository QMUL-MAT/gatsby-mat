Through user interaction, structural grammars are arranged leading to unique interpretations of prearranged musical components. The interface is designed to foster heuristic development, and quickly leads an effective mix of intuitive and indeterminate responses. The Tesseract can be used alone, or as a participatory tool for generative listening, composition or performance.
Beneath the physical interface, a rule based system combines elements in such a way as to afford agency to its user/s, while maintaining a degree of tonal, timbral and rhythmical hierarchy.
The Tesseract is an experiment in music release and seeks to question the relationship we have with a musical product. In our post-modern world of remix culture, the object is merely a reflection of that once real; surely the only reality then is that which resists reflection (Baudrillard 1994/ Debord 1984).
