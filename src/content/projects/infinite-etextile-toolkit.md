Electronic textiles have extended electronics to the field of textiles and fashion, where designers are increasingly becoming interested in using e-textiles to designs.Infinite provides a low entry threshold for fashion and textile designers who have no prior experience in electronics and allows for open-ended textile interface explorations. It encourages designers to create interfaces out of raw materials in the context of their fashion or textiles projects.
