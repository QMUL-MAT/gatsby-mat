Text and iles, an interactive installation, consists of two capacitive knitted jumpers that react to being touched. They respond to visitorsâ€™ caresses with audio recordings of particles of a poem. This creates a dialogue not just between the garments, but also between the clothing and its wearers, commenting on the relationship between textile and tactile intimacy.
