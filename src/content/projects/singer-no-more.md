The project submitted for the Cruftfest 2018 was based around an old sewing machine, hidden in a decaying wooden box at the back of a small market stall in Deptford market. This became the cruft upon which my interface was designed. Using the sewing machine, an Arduino, multiple sensors and Max/MSP (Max) I put together an interactive audio sampler system.
