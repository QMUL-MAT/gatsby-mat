Created from the shell of a broken reel to reel tape machine, the reels have been transformed into a tactile interface. The performer’s motions on each reel, measured by an incremental rotary encoder, control the direction and speed of playback of a virtual tape loop. The performer’s motions on each knob, measured by a logarithmic potentiometer, control the volume of the master output of the virtual tape loop and two direct audio sources (from which the tape loop is created), as well as trigger new audio onto the virtual tape loop. The instrument is powered by an embedded Bela microcomputer running Pure Data.
