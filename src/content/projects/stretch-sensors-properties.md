This work presents a control experiment for how bonding and washing affects the smart textile resistance. The experiment has been designed to compare the performance of three smart textile strain sensors, conductive fabric Techik-tex P130B with no reinforcement, conductive fabric Techik-tex P130B with Eurojersey backing, and Techik-tex P130B with Eurojersey bonded top and bottom. The sensorsâ€™ performance was tested using a tensile tester while monitoring their resistance with a microcontroller. Each sensor underwent a dynamic test, static test and wash test. The finding shows that bonding and washing effects sensors properties.
