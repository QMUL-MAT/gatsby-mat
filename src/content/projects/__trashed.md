Moody Teletubbie (Twinky Winky) is an installation that explores human emotion and emotionally mimetic machine behaviour.
For an AI System to produce a linguistically creative explanation it should be able to understand the emotional intents of the human that addresses the dialogue system.
Twinky listens to human speech and reacts to a pressure sensor. It becomes excited, angry, depressed, calm or in a neutral mood depending on the voice amplitude and pressure strenght, reflecting its emotions through multi-colored LEDs and its stomach TV.
Technologies: Arduino IDE, MAX MSP.
