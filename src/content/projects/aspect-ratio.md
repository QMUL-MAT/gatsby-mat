The sculpture consists of screens made of stone, bronze, iron and plastics. Each material is sized in different aspect ratios to investigate the relationship between conventionality and temporality of technologies.
An embedded movement sensor transforms the sculpture into ambient light through projected light, and invites visitors to intervene in determining the aspect ratio of everyday gadgets.
