Krasnikov Tube was a Mobile VR game made as part of a placement at M&C Saatchi Innovation, built in collaboration with fellow MAT students Liang Men and Anel Kudebayeva.
The game incorporated stereoscopic video and interactive VR into a lightweight mobile app for Google Cardboard. It was built as part of a research project into narrative strategies for interactive VR, with a focus on user experience, incorporating game instructions and narrative in a seamless manner within VR.
