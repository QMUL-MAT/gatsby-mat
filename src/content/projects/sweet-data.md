Sweet Data is an autonomous interactive sweet dispenser (often referred to as a “gum-ball machine”), augmented with a webcam to allow users’ to “pay for” a sweet via their personal data.
To facilitate this, the machine’s coin-operated mechanism was replaced with a dispensing method controlled via a front-mounted touchscreen and top-mounted webcam. A thermal printer was added to allow users’ to print a receipt of their data transaction, and to serve as an explanation.
The project was an output from a larger piece of research into how to raise awareness of data privacy and usage issues for digitally-vulnerable people.
