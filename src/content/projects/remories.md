Designing the interaction requirements of an App for people with Asperger\’s syndrome. The Placement Project researched if and how the interaction design of the App should be changed and adapted to the special needs of people with Asperger\’s, as they show a different mindset and a different way of interpreting language. The research run parallel to the App\’s development phase and included a combination of User-Centred Design methods, among which prototyping sessions with young people with Asperger\’s and interviews with therapists.
Remories is a start-up company, hosted in the CIID\’s incubator, the NEST. The homonymous App uses theory from Narrative Therapy to support people with Asperger\’s in everyday activities and planning, with the ultimate goal to reduce their social anxiety.
