A controller for full-body interactive performances that requires applying force and effort to play with, hopefully facilitating expressiveness. It is composed of two elastic bands that are attached to the players\’ belt loops, and a main unit that measures the tension on each elastic band. The player holds the other side of each elastic band and stretches them to play. The controller is demonstrated using a generative drum machine by mapping the stretch of the bands to tempo and the pitch of the samples.
