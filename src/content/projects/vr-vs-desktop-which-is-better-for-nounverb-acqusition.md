Immersive virtual environments (IVEs) are increasingly being explored as potential educational tools. However, it isunclear  which  aspects  of  IVEs  contribute  to  learning,  including hardware  modalities  and  learner  responses  (e.g.  motivation,  us-ability, cognitive load and presence). One IVE hardware modality particularly  backed  by  theory  is  embodied  controls,  with  their potential for leveraging embodied cognition for enhanced learn-ing  outcomes.  
This  research project  explores  if  embodied  controls  can  beleveraged to enhance learning in an IVE by comparing language learning  outcomes  from  an  IVE  using  embodied  controls,  anda  non-embodied  control.  It  explores  two  words  classes  –  verbs and  nouns  –  to  examine  if  there  is  a  difference  in  learningoutcome  for  embodied  controls  with  actions  (verbs)  and  object interactions (nouns). This paper also explores co-variables oftenlinked  with  IVE  learning  (motivation,  presence,  cognitive  load) to understand why learning gain occurs. It finds that leveragingembodied  controls  provides  better  learning  outcomes,  with  noimpact  on  cognitive  load.  It  also  finds  that  the  benefit  does  notcorrelate  with  motivation  or  presence  ratings,  suggesting  that embodiment-induced motivation or immersion is not the cause of the learning enhancements, and therefore this could be evidence for embodied cognition-based  learning  in  IVEs.
