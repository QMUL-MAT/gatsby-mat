Metronome Music Time Capsule inverts and plays with a fundamental musical principle. In music, a metronome dictates the temporal aspects of what is heard. Conversely, the capsule uses individual pieces of music to define a particular point in time. An electronic metronome is repurposed as a tangible interface to access an archive of 25 recordings, spanning 1940-2012, with on-screen graphical data. BPM values on the metronome dial are mapped to corresponding years. The pieces represent that chronological moment, as an objective document of contemporary technical, musical and social forces. Though the software and audio files are transmissible to anyone, anywhere, they can only be explored and experienced interactively, as a material collection, using the capsule.
