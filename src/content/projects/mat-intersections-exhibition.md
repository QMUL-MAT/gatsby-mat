Approaching the theme of Ethics and Politics in Media and Arts Technology from a more experimental and artistic perspective, our curated exhibition showcases the work of internationally renowned designers and artists alongside our own PhD students\’ mixed media artworks.
We also present work by Will Hurt and Yosuke Ushigome. Will\’s artwork, commissioned for Inter/sections, draws visitors\’ attention to built environments, while Yosuke\’s invites visitors to explore shared economies.
