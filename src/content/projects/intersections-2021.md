Intersections is an annual event organised by the PhD students of the Media and Arts Technology programme. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we skipped 2020, but returned in 2021 with a fully-online two-day event of talks and workshops.
The event split into three blocks. Day 1 started with an e-textile workshop about crafting a pompom musical instrument and was followed by an interactive panel discussion about technologically mediated bodies. The whole of Day 2 focused on producing and discussing spatial audio.
