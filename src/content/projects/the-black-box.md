The Black Box is an interactive piece [series 0/20] which explores the pervasive omnipresence of algorithms in contemporary society, ultimately suggesting the possibility to question their regulatory power or the detention of the truth. Graham White says: “In our times, algorithms are treated with the same reverence, mixed with incomprehension, that was formerly restricted to religious objects; this work goes further by investing an algorithm with further attributes of the divine, namely incomprehensibility and inaccessibility.”
