This installation forms part of a fictional proposal to bring back the worldâ€™s oldest and now defunct currency of Greece, the Drachma. Bacteria residues on the surface of the banknote is harvested and re-grown on an agar surface. Their growth is controlled by translating the rise and the fall of a Greek stock market (Athens General Index) into heat and electricity, that are fed directly into the microbial culture.
