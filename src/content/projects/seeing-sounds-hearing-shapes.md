Humans are capable of detecting the most minute differences between noises, but struggle to accurately describe how a sound sounds. For Seeing Sounds, Hearing Shapes 28 participants were asked to describe a sound by sketching an image. This web app invites visitors to explore these images and test their perception of sound in an interactive game.
