μαζί (pronounced Mazi), from the Greek “together” is a sonic tangible user interface for children with autism designed to stimulate active participation; independent, spontaneous and collaborative play, and provide self-regulation. It’s been developed as part of Antonella’s first exploratory study as a P.h.D research student at MAT, Queen Mary University in London.
Mazi has been exhibited at Ars Electronica 2018 in Linz, AT, as part of the Campus Exhibition Exploration of Interactions of QMUL, between 6-10 September.
