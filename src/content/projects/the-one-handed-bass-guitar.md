In 2016, Jacob Harrison worked with the One-Handed Musical Instrument (OHMI) Trust on a prototype adapted bass guitar, supervised by Dr Andrew McPherson. This was part of the Advanced Placement Project in the first year of the MAT program
After surveying a group of bass guitar players, we found that the most important aspects of bass guitar playing involved plucking hand gestures – for example timing and dynamics. In order to preserve these aspects of bass performance, we developed a mechanical fretting adaptation that could be controlled with the feet. The initial design was awarded the ‘best concept’ prize at the annual OHMI competition
