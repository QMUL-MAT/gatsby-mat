Virtual Reality may provide a greater sense of community and more intuitive interactions in comparison to traditional media, and may also offer new opportunities human-computer interaction and human-to-human interaction.
Whilst the potential of multi-user immersive virtual reality to facilitate social activities is well established, few VR applications currently exist in the field of music collaboration. Consequently, there are many open research questions on how to design VR user experiences to support Collaborative Music Making (CMM).
We created a virtual music making tool called Letâ€™s Move (LeMo), which is a social virtual environment for CMM. LeMo provides two people with a shared virtual reality musical interface with which they can make music together. The studies during my PhD focus on LeMo and are aiming at exploring the impact of different interaction cues (visual, aural, proximity, annotation, awareness and so on) on CMM.
