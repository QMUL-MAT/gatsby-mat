These tailor made smart trousers are able to capture a variety of behaviours and body movement from textile sensors alone. A fabric pressure sensing matrix is embedded unintrusively around the legs of the trousers and can identify sitting postures, as well as discriminate between speaker and listener behaviours in social encounters.
