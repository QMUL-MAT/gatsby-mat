For our inaugural symposium we discussed symbiosis between arts, media, science and technology. This was a reflection on how research observes the changing link between ourselves, technology, and our perception of the world. We discussed the broad research conducted within MAT and how this research is adding to the dialogue of change. To investigate this concept on the day, conversations around the nature of interactivity, empowerment and associated research methodologies hoped to build an understanding of current research and uncover future avenues of exploration within the symbiosis of media, arts, science, and technology.
Keynote talks by Bill Gaver and Hannah Redler
