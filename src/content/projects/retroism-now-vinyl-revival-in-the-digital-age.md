The resurgence of vinyl record sales over recent years has been well-reported. ‘Retroism Now’ examines the motivations behind this revival, which are complex and inter-related, involving under-defined and malleable notions of fidelity, authenticity, engagement and identity. This collaboration was shortlisted for the ‘Best Documentary’ award at Mk2 Corto Fest in Spain, October 2019 – one of just 60 films shortlisted for the festival from 700 submissions.
