Osci-rhythm is a new musical interface which produces melodic patterns synchronised with someoneâ€™s performance on an electronic drum. It extracts rhythmic structure from a monophonic MIDI-stream, entraining to different metrical levels of frequency patterns in an audio signal, and sonifying them. At the heart of it is a gradient frequency neural network (GrFNN),  a neural network which mimics human rhythm perception.
