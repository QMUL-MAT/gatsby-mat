This Unity project offers a series of templates for designers to quickly create their own play-anywhere location-based games and stories. Each page can be customised accordingly and the final experience made available for iOS or Android phones. Users will be led by audio tracks to local places of significance, where they can interact with the designer's choice of virtual content through AR.
