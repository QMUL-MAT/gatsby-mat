50 years ago, the cartoonist Bruno Bozzetto published “Life in a Box”, suggesting a representation of human life as a continuous movement inside limited spaces, or boxes.
Starting from this concept, not(e)Allowed takes the abstract idea of “box” as a set of edges, limits and borders that we encounter in every day life and often made by others, regardless of the will and thoughts of whom lives within them.
The movement inside these borders is allowed but what happens if one of the edges is reached? Is it possible to go beyond it? What happens when the passive interaction that is happening within the allowed area is not enough? Are we able to set ourselves in a position of “active” interaction and to gain control over the edges of our box?
