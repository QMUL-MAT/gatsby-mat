Making absurd, surreal and silly musical propositions. Composing unconventional artefacts challenging current music technology. Subverting the ways we use musical tools to reveal unstated assumptions and explore alternatives. Artists, technologists and makers took part in a hackathon around the themes of absurd musical interfaces, questionable sonic interactions and unworkable music designs.
As result, the designed artefacts illustrate future visions, based on musical and artistic accounts as well as technical intuitions and methodological guidelines. These provocative statements offer critical viewpoints to be shared with broader design research communities.
