The Garden of Forking Paths is an online exhibition that was created by MAT PhD students and was first presented at the <a href="https://ars.electronica.art/keplersgardens/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ars Electronica Festival 2020</a>. It showcases seven interactive artworks, demos and performances, all the product of current PhD research. Working with sound, image, text, materials, and structure, each piece explores aspects of how we think, sense and act when physical and digital worlds collide. 

The exhibition has reached over 2000 unique visitors so far and remains available to explore via <a href="https://forkingpaths.intersections.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forkingpaths.intersections.io</a>.
