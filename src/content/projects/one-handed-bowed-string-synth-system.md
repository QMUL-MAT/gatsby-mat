This standalone digital system was developed for the One-Handed Musical Instrument (OHMI) Trust and enables performance of bowed-string timbres and playing techniques using single-handed interaction. It was recognised with an OHMI award in 2018 for seamlessly integrating the LinnStrument expressive touch keyboard interface and SWAM Strings physical modelling / sample-based VSTi using an accessible design. Bespoke software intelligently manages and interprets MIDI controller data to optimise the musicality and flexibility of the interface. Hardware interfacing via an embedded microcomputer enables screen-free operation, which is essential for effective use and performance within mainstream instrumental music education settings.
