The Octoqin is a modern and absurdist recreation of the traditional Chinese Duxianqin, one-stringed instrument, created to test the boundaries of what one can consider an instrument, and what one can consider a duxianqin.
Using cutting-edge sound synthesis, etextiles and a plush octopus, the Octoqin is made and played here at the Chinese Central Conservatory of Music.
