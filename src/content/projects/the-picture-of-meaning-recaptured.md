The installation demsontrates that the picture of meaning can be recaptured with the presence of the self that is (non)present in real time, while reading a text that is either concrete, blended or invisible depending on where the person stands.
The idea is based on the Picture Theory of Ludwig Wittgenstein, who stated that statements are meaningful only if they are described or pictured in real world. I use the theory in order to figuratively enable people to experience the meaning of words in real time.
