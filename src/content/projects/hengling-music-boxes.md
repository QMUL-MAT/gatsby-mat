Hengling Music Boxes are interactive artifacts inspired by the Dong ethnic minority culture in rural China. The artifacts are part of The New Channel Program 2016 â€“ part of the DESIS Design Network for Social Innovate and Sustainability. The four artifacts focused on Interaction Design with Audio and were created in a popup maker space in Hengling Village, Changsha Province with locally-sourced found objects and materials.
