Ghost Fuzz is a conceptually simple audio effect that unites commonly-used processing systems and their typical parameters into a single plugin. It combines a delay, distortion and filter bank to apply a range of timbral transformations to only the delayed component of incoming signals. Ghost Fuzz aims to optimise utility and usability for this specific combination of effects in a straightforward package. Using dedicated effects to achieve similar outcomes in a DAW requires bussing between patches and dislocates user interaction and control. This single plugin enables focussed manipulation for more immediate and intuitive experimentation, or use in environments that lack flexible signal routing (such as GarageBand).
