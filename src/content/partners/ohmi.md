Pronounced 'oh-me', the One-Handed Musical Instrument Trust is a UK-based charity pioneering the development and adaptation of musical instruments for the physically disabled. Any deficiency in one hand or arm makes traditional instruments unplayable to any reasonable standard. As a result, millions across the world are excluded from music-making for the lack of suitable instruments.
