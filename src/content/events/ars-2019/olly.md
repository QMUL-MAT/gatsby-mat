# Antonella Nonnis – Ολοι

Ολοι (pronounced Olly) from the Greek “all” is a tangible sonic interface made in felt and stretch lycra. The idea was that of creating an orchestra where different instruments are activated by pulling the coloured stretch lycra.

Each instrument plays a different scale of notes. When the lycra strings are pulled together the sounds form a soothing composition and the users are able to create different harmonies.

The work was developed to stimulate social interactions during play time with Ολοι for a group of five minimally to non-verbal children with autism who like music.
