# Giacomo Lepri â€“ Chowndolo

The Chowndolo is an interactive sonic sculpture based on a magnetic pendulum: an oscillating stick whose trajectories are altered by magnets placed underneath the device.

The unstable patterns produced by the pendulum oscillations are transformed into sound, articulating music which evolves based on the pendulum motions. The magnets at the bottom of the pendulum can be arranged to compose new shapes. Different configurations will therefore modify the pendulum oscillations and the sonic patterns.

# About the artist [(view profile)](/students/lalepre/)

[Giacomo](/students/lalepre/) is a musician, sonic interaction designer and researcher. Although he is specialised in not being specialised, his work often involves the development of interactive musical systems for electroacoustic improvisation and interactive sonic sculptures.

He is currently busy with a PhD research exploring the cultural implications of new musical instrument design at the Augmented Instruments Laboratory.
