# Nicole Robson â€“ Rhythm of the Heart

Inspired by artistic activities that bring new life and meaning to everyday objects, Rhythm of the Heart is an interactive installation that repurposes a metronome to move in time with our heartbeat.

It reverses our relationship with the object and exacts a kind of revenge as the metronome fights against its pendulum mechanism to swing in time with our internal rhythm. At the same time, the tempo of an accompanying song by dance band Stats fluctuates with your heartbeat as you breathe and move.
