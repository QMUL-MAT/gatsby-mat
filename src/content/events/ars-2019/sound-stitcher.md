# Brendan O'Connor â€“ Sound Stitcher

Sound Stitcher comes in the form of a 100-year-old sewing machine. Although it no longer functions as before, participants can still interact with its variety of controls to design noise instead of cloth.

With each interaction, the acoustic properties of sounds generated by the piece become mangled and distorted beyond recognition, paying homage to the battery and abandonment these discarded pieces of machinery have endured over the years.

He has presented his work with creative, media-interactive communities such as Hackoustic, Heart N Soul, and the Irish Sound Science and Technology Association.
