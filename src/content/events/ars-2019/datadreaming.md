# Andrea Guidi â€“ Data Dreaming

Data Dreaming is a multimedia performative installation driving nuanced gestures to create ethereal audio-visual compositions with an interface resembling a household lamp.

Rather than addressing functional requirements, the wood pyramidal object invites viewers to explore and compose enchanted sonic textures and fictional visual renders. Inspired by the internet of things (IOT) technological shift, the installation depicts an alternative future where household appliances and data are elicited for creative aims.
