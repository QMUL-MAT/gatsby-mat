# Anna Nolda Nagele – Machina Incantaii

The work Machina Incantatii is a wall hanging made of conductive yarns and fabrics that combines physical and representational materials into an interface for a magical ritual. By touching the conductive patches on the cloth, powers assigned to the elements of this world and energies of the universe are called upon to generate new knowledge and meaning.

The “old” periodic alignments of the stars are a poetic parallelism to the “new” periodic alignments of the Markov chains used for casting a spell and generating an incantation.
