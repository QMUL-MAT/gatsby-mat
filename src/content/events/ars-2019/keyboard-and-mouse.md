# Jacktionman – Keyboard + Mouse

If the medium is the message, then in an age of cyber-bullying, trolls & great political divides, is it time to consider the impact of the interfaces of our online communication?

This piece, an interactive keyboard and mouse made using 100% natural wool, invites the audience to experience whether the softening of our hardware could soften our harsh communication edges. Could replacing plastic, metal and glass (the ubiquitous materials of online interaction) with natural, gentle, tactile, transient alternatives, allow for more humanity in our digitality?

The keyboard is created almost entirely from wool, with layers of differening thickness to replicate the keyboard base, key switches and key caps found on typical plastic and metal consumer keyboards.
