# Lia Mice – INSTRUMENT SEMATARY

INSTRUMENT SEMATARY is an interactive sonic sculpture created from broken, pre-owned classical instruments that have been brought back to life with a new digital identity.

Inspired by Stephen King’s Pet Sematary in which deceased animals return to life with unfamiliar, evil personalities, this work explores the environmental choices of musicians and instrument designers, and our responsibilities to preserve historical hand-crafted musical instruments that are becoming increasingly out of fashion in a digital age.
