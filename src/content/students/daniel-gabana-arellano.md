Daniel is a multidisciplinary researcher interested in affective computing, human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI) for health and wellbeing. My current research focuses on developing cognitive training and rehabilitation programs using immersive technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR). Using machine learning, we can assess the userâ€™s affective states, progress and struggles to adapt the training and provide a more effective and personalised program. Daniel is also interested in video games and gamification as a tool to engage users, not only in training but also in education and learning programs. He strongly believe games are not only an art form but also a serious media.
