Entrepreneur since 10 years now, passionate about science and technology. Founder of OVOMIND: an Affective Computing (Neuroscience and IoT) startup founded in Japan in 2019 and selected in 2021 by Conception X as Venture PhD. OVOMIND has the mission to add a new interactive dimension in HMIs with an emotional layer through the Cloud. I have started a MAT PhD at QMUL in 2020 to go further in my entrepreneurial project.
