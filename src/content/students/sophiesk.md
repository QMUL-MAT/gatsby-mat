I'm researching on how to use textile sensing to capture social behaviours. Currently, I work on ‘smart’ trousers that distinguish between speakers and listeners.

With a background in fashion design and mathematics, an interdisciplinary approach has always been important in my work practices, both in the design industry and academia. For example, I have programmed prime number structures into knitwear and used equations from astro-physics to construct patterns for tailored jackets.

My interests are scattered around textile technology, social sciences, and fields surrounding those.
