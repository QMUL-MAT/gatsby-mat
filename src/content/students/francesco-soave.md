Hi!

I’m Francesco and I was born in Verona (Italy) in 1990.
After completing a degree in “Computer Science Applied to Music” (University of Milan), a Postgraduate Diploma in “Interactive Digital Media” (Ravensbourne College, London), and a Master in “Computing with Digital Media” (University of Sussex, Brighton) I am currently pursuing a PhD in Media Arts and Technology. My research topic is: Haptics & Sound to Represent Motion in Virtual Reality.
