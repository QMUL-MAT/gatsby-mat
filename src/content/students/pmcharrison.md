I use computational modelling to investigate music from various perspectives: Music theory (how do composers write music?); Psychology (what cognitive processes underly music perception?); Neuroscience (how are these psychological processes implemented in the brain?). I build computational models instantiating various music-theoretic or psychological hypotheses, and then evaluate these models empirically on large datasets of music compositions and perceptual data from human listeners.
