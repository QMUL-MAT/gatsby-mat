Sebastian Löbbers is a researcher, software developer and musician currently working at the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London. His research investigates how poeple represent musical timbre through simple drawings and aims to develop a sound synthesiser that can be controlled through a visual input. Besides research, he develops interactive software/artworks and composes music for contemporary dance, film and video games. His works have been staged and exhibited internationally in galleries, performance halls and music venues. Recent projects have been displayed at the Edinburgh Science Festival, Ars Electronica and the WeSA Festival.
