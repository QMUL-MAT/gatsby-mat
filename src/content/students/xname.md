Drawing upon her personal experience with audio and video manipulation and interactive art, Eleonora Oreggia experiments with the electromagnetic field as a sensor system. Her research explores the concept of illusion by creating electromagnetic environments that stimulate new forms of perception. 

Invisible affordances become a means to control and communicate with the machine, whose aesthetics inspire the sentiment of the sublime. Musical instruments and interactive systems allow, then, a form of expressive interaction that includes moments of hesitation, uncertainty, surprise. Technology, like a companion, reclaims the possibility of going out of control, in that tension between programmability, virtuosity and causality.
