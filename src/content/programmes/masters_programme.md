Be part of a new generation of designers, engineers and researchers who are applying digital innovation to the creative sector by combining human-computer interaction with creative computing. This MSc will teach you how to combine advanced technical and creative computing skills to shape digital transformation and improve lives.

- Be taught by expert academics who are undertaking innovative and world-class research in creative computing.
- Benefit from a flexible and cross-disciplinary programme structure organised around three themes: _1) Sound, Image, and Games_, _2) Interaction, Intelligence, and Sensing_ and _3) Creative Industry_.
- Tailor your degree to your interests and choose from a wide variety of technical, practical and business-oriented modules.
- Access to our [state-of-the-art facilities](/facilities/) including the world-class qMedia Studios, the Materials Processing Lab, MAT equipment and the Electronics Lab.
- Wide range of career opportunities in industry and academia.

# What you’ll study

You will undertake compulsory modules where you will learn creative computing techniques, interactive system design and user evaluation, and study data analytics methodologies and tools.

These compulsory modules will give you a common grounding in core technical and creative skills and ensure that you are able to develop enhanced skills through specialist options.

You will also choose from a wide range of elective module options which are split into three different themes:

- _Sound, Image, and Games_: this theme is concerned with theoretical and practical skills for the production and computational analysis of audiovisual content, as well as perceptual perspectives on media
- _Interaction, Intelligence, and Sensing_: this theme is concerned with theoretical and practical skills relevant for media and arts technology including creative computing, research methods, artificial intelligence for audiovisual media, advanced sensing and Internet of Things, robotics, and computational creativity
- _Creative Industry_: this theme is concerned with strategic management of research and development for innovative technology-based organisations, including ethics, legal, and intellectual property aspects applied to advanced digital information processing

If you have no prior programming experience and want to develop Computer Science skills, you can choose computer programming elective modules in the first semester.

You will devise and carry out a major dissertation under the supervision of an academic within the School. Projects in collaboration with industrial partners are regularly proposed.

# Testimonials

![Sara Anne Wigglesworth](./masters_programme_sara.jpg)

_“Queen Mary is a welcoming institution and provides excellent facilities for its students. In the Media and Arts Technology Masters, I found rich opportunities to freely exercise my creative vision in many projects. My success in the programme would not have been possible without all the support I received from my classmates, professors, and the staff. I enjoyed every minute of it. My teachers were engaging, inspirational and continuously pushed me to advance my research!”_

_“This course relies on perseverance and the willingness to learn. The knowledge and skills that I gained throughout this programme, I now use in my everyday life. From developing my knowledge around project management to creative coding and new media technology, the Media and Arts Technology Masters has benefited my career as a professional musician. It has greatly improved my creativity and inspirations as I now incorporate computer-generated visualisations into my art, with the aim of creating novel audiovisual experiences for my audience. Great work is also recognised, and I’m thankful for the opportunity to co-author an international conference paper along with other brilliant individuals.”_
