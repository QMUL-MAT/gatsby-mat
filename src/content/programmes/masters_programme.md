_“Queen Mary is a welcoming institution and provides excellent facilities for its students. In the Media and Arts Technology Masters, I found rich opportunities to freely exercise my creative vision in many projects. My success in the programme would not have been possible without all the support I received from my classmates, professors, and the staff. I enjoyed every minute of it. My teachers were engaging, inspirational and continuously pushed me to advance my research!”_

_“This course relies on perseverance and the willingness to learn. The knowledge and skills that I gained throughout this programme, I now use in my everyday life. From developing my knowledge around project management to creative coding and new media technology, the Media and Arts Technology Masters has benefited my career as a professional musician. It has greatly improved my creativity and inspirations as I now incorporate computer-generated visualisations into my art, with the aim of creating novel audiovisual experiences for my audience. Great work is also recognised, and I’m thankful for the opportunity to co-author an international conference paper along with other brilliant individuals.”_
