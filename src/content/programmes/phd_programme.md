The PhD in Media and Arts Technology was an innovative four year full time programme, unique in the UK. The MAT PhD programme is now closed and does not accept applications.

The PhD built on the outstanding success of Queen Maryâ€™s Media and Arts Technology (MAT) Centre for Doctoral Training. The MAT PhD programme provided an integrated programme of taught modules and PhD research which accommodates students with existing Masters qualifications from other disciplines. The taught modules specifically train students in the technologies and techniques used in inter-disciplinary research in Technologies for the Media and Arts.

The PhD in Media and Arts Technology programme had three main components:

1. Six advanced taught modules ranging from advanced technical skills to interaction design;
2. An advanced research project;
3. PhD research examined by thesis and viva.
   
The main research groups contributing to the programme were:

- [Antennas](http://antennas.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/)
- [Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/)
- [Centre for Intelligent Sensing](http://cis.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/)
- [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/)
- [Multimedia and Vision](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/research/view/multimedia-and-vision-mmv)
- [Advanced Robotics](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/robotics/)
  
Year 1 followed the structure of the MRes in Media and Arts Technology. The taught modules gave each cohort a common grounding in core technical and creative skills and ensured that each student developed enhanced skills through specialist options. We made extensive use of studio based projects with a variety of technical media, to encourage a "maker" culture and integrate public presentation into coursework assessments.

Programming was taught as a fundamentally creative process and we underlined the importance of understanding arts practice to successful technical work. In year 1 students took three core modules, three advanced elective modules, and a research project.
In years 2, 3, 4 students followed the usual EECS PhD progress points and were examined as an EECS PhD student by submission of thesis and viva.
