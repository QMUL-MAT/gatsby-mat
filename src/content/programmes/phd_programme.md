# PhD programme structure

The PhD builds on the outstanding success of Queen Mary’s Media and
Arts Technology (MAT) Centre for Doctoral Training. In contrast to
other PhD programmes in the UK the MAT PhD programme provides an
integrated programme of taught modules and PhD research which
accommodates students with existing Masters qualifications from
other disciplines. The taught modules specifically train students in
the technologies and techniques used in inter-disciplinary research
in Technologies for the Media and Arts.

The PhD in Media and Arts Technology programme has three main
components:

1. Six advanced taught modules ranging from advanced technical skills to interaction design;
2. An advanced research project;
3. PhD research examined by thesis and viva.

The programme is structured as follows:

- Year 1: 90 credits of taught modules, and 90 credits of research project
- Years 2, 3, 4, 5: PhD research programme following the progression points of EECS PhD policies and procedures

The main research groups contributing to the programme are:

- [Antennas](http://antennas.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/)
- [Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/)
- [Centre for Intelligent Sensing](http://cis.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/)
- [Cognitive Science](http://cogsci.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/)
- [Multimedia and Vision](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/research/view/multimedia-and-vision-mmv)
- [Advanced Robotics](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/robotics/)

## Year 1

Year 1 follows the structure of the MRes in Media and Arts
Technology. The taught modules give each cohort a common grounding
in core technical and creative skills and ensure that each student
develops enhanced skills through specialist options. We make
extensive use of studio based projects with a variety of technical
media, encourage a "maker" culture and integrate public presentation
into coursework assessments.

Programming is taught as a fundamentally creative process and we
underline the importance of understanding arts practice to
successful technical work. In year 1 students take three core
modules, three advanced elective modules, and a research project.

## Core modules are usually:

- Interactive Digital Multimedia Techniques ("IDMT"; ECS742) covers
  physical computing (sensors and microcontrollers) and creative
  audio/video programming with a focus on creating interactive
  systems. Several IDMT coursework projects have subsequently been
  accepted at major international conferences like ACM CHI.
- Sound Recording and Production Techniques (ECS749) covers core
  principles of digital audio and practical techniques in
  microphones, mixing desks and audio post-production. By learning
  how content is created, students are also better able to
  understand how best to analyse it.
- Advanced Research Methods (ECS719) covers the generic high-level
  research and transferable skills applicable to pure and applied
  research in computer science. It will also prepare students for
  employment or further academic study by enabling them to apply
  these in relevant, practical contexts.

## Suggested elective modules to choose from are:

Semester 1 (one elective):

- Computer Programming (ECS780P) or Software & Network Services
  Design (ECS705P) which both cover an introduction to
  programming for novice programmers.
- Design for Human Interaction (ECS712P) this research led module
  explores the effectiveness of the design of new technologies by
  introducing psychological theories of the nature of human
  communication and socio-historical perspectives on the development
  and impact of communication technologies.

Semester 2 (two electives):

- Interactive System Design (ECS733P) covers design and evaluations
  of users interfaces and so compliments IDMT.
- Graphical User Interfaces (ECS744P) covers basic concepts of
  psychology Human-Computer Interaction which inform the way in
  which interfaces should be designed.
- Artificial Intelligence (ECS759P) provides an overview of
  techniques used in Artificial Intelligence including agent
  modelling, problem formulation, search, logic, probability and
  machine learning.
- Music and Speech Modelling (ECS792P) introduces students to the
  mathematical and computational modelling of expressivity in music
  and in spoken language through a problem based learning approach.
- Digital Audio Effects (ECS730P) covers the entire field of digital
  audio effects, including some depth in the subfields and related
  subjects. It is concerned with the use of digital signal
  processing and its applications to the creation or modification of
  sounds and sound effects.


Other electives are possible from level 7 EECS Modules. Note that
core modules may change from year to year depending on availability
and timetabling.

The research project is a five month research project with the
student’s identified PhD supervisor. The project provides an
opportunity to put to practice the research skills learnt in the
taught modules, and to finalise the research proposal for the
PhD study after year 1. The project is assessed by dissertation
and viva.

## Years 2, 3, 4

In years 2, 3, 4 students follow usual EECS PhD progress points and
are examined as an EECS PhD student by submission of thesis and viva
as per EECS PhD policies and procedures.

**Please note**: The MAT PhD Programme is a four year
full-time programme. You must be able to commit full-time to the
programme. This is not a practice-based PhD. Final
examination of the PhD is by thesis and viva.

# How to apply

This is a highly interdisciplinary programme and we welcome
applications from a range of backgrounds. What we require is some
clear evidence of both technical and creative abilities. We invite
new applications from outstanding individuals with any Arts,
Engineering or Science background and welcome applications from
people with a strong background the visual arts, design,
architecture, New Media, User Experience, human-computer
interaction, and from people with a strong backgrounds in social
science e.g. psychology, sociology, or a similar
discipline. You will be able to develop additional skills
through the selection of specialist options.
